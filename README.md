# Model_Deployment_Flask

A demo project for a toy dataset that applies machine learning model to Flask

# Dataset

Retrieved from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlolepelaars/toy-dataset

# Prerequisite

Numpy, Pandas, Scikit Learn, Flask installed

# Structure

1. model.py - contains the code for machine learning models that fit the training data to predict the illness 

2. app.py - contains the Flask API that computes the predicted value based on the model 

3. templates - contains the index.html, which will direct to a web page, and allow user to enter values for independent variables and predict the target variable Illness
